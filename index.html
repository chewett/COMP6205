<h2>Skills Enhanced and tools used</h2>

<h3>Skills Enhanced</h3>

We shall be looking to enhance our knowledge of Role based authentication and logging.

<h3>Tools</h3>

<ul>
	<li>PHP - We shall base all of our work on PHP as we have both previously used this language to write websites.</li>
	<li>MySQL Database - We shall use a MySQL database to store the data</li>
	<li>PHPUnit - We will use the PHPUnit testing framework as we have used JUnit testing before</li>
	<li>Bootstrap - We shall be using the Twitter Bootstrap theme to help us write a responsive website</li>
	<li>Dojo - Dojo has a large number of JavaScript widgets that fall back to native HTML elements when the browser doesn't support them.
		This will allow us to make a website that will be accessible.</li>
	<li>Doctrine - Doctrine is a ORM layer for PHP that </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>

<h2>Description of Web Application</h2>
<p> The app will have basic banking features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Log in</li>
  <li>Register</li>
  <li>Services</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Transfer money</li>
      <li>View statements</li>
      <li>Open new account</li>
      <li>View account</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Contact us/About page</li>
    <li>Admin page</li>
  </ul>
<p>There will also be different roles such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Customer</li>
  <li>Clerk</li>
  <li>Bank Manager </li>
  <li>Admin</li>
</ul>
<p>The roles will be organised in hierarchical manner, so that admins will be able to promote or demote people to be clerks or bank managers. Clerks will be able to view customer transactions and eventually resolve issues. Bank managers will be able to disable accounts and fire clerks</p>

<h2>User Stories</h2>

<ol>
	<ul>
		A user will want to create an account. Once created they should be able to login and create an account.
		For the purposes of this prototype accounts are created automatically and need no further approval.
		If we were to continue working with this we will ensure that bank managers approve account creation.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		A clerk will want to add and remove money from an account. They will be using the interface in branch and as people present money to be cashed they will add this into the account.
		In a real situation this would be patrolled and properly dealt with but we are not concerning ourselves with this.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		A bank manager will want to be able to do all that a Clerk can do but also have the ability to disable accounts for users that are not using their account properly and also register clerks.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		An admin should be able to access the entire system and perform all actions that any other level of access can perform.
	</ul>
</ol>
